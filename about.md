      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Happy</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m Happy, a Junior Cloud Security Engineer learning AWS, cloud, security and everything in between. 
      I’m a girl finding my path in cloud security, learning AWS step by step. I don’t have all the answers yet, 
      but I believe in showing the process — the wins, the mistakes, and the lessons in between.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>I aim to become a Cloud Security Engineer who understands AWS inside out, builds secure systems, 
    and keeps learning every day. I also want to inspire other young women in tech to explore cloud and 
    cybersecurity confidently. This blog is my space to share what I’m learning as I go.</p>
