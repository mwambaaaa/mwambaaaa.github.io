  <p>Hello! I’m Happy, a Junior Cloud Security Engineer learning AWS, cloud, security and everything in between. I’m a girl finding my path in cloud security, learning AWS step by step. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I believe in showing the process — the wins, the mistakes, and the lessons in between.

    I started this journey after a few missteps — like locking myself out of my AWS root account — and I’m sharing my lessons to help others avoid the same pitfalls.</p>

  <h2>My Goals</h2>
  <p>I aim to become a Cloud Security Engineer who understands AWS inside out, builds secure systems, and keeps learning every day. I also want to inspire other young women in tech to explore cloud and cybersecurity confidently.

  This blog is my space to share what I’m learning as I go. If you’re starting out in AWS too, I hope you’ll see that it’s normal to trip up, and that every problem can turn into a lesson worth sharing.And if you’re a recruiter or mentor reading this: you’ll find someone who’s committed, curious, and learning by doing — the kind of growth that lasts.</p>
