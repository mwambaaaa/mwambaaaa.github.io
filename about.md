Hi, Iâ€™m Happy ðŸŒ¸  

Iâ€™m a girl finding my path in cloud security, learning AWS step by step. I donâ€™t have all the answers yet, but I believe in showing the process â€” the wins, the mistakes, and the lessons in between.  

When I first opened my AWS account, I made the classic beginnerâ€™s mistake: using the root account for everything. Then I lost access to my MFA device and got locked out for months. It was frustrating, but it pushed me to learn about IAM, least privilege, and the importance of doing things right from the start.  

This blog is my space to share what Iâ€™m learning as I go. If youâ€™re starting out in AWS too, I hope youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s normal to trip up, and that every problem can turn into a lesson worth sharing.  

And if youâ€™re a recruiter or mentor reading this: youâ€™ll find someone whoâ€™s committed, curious, and learning by doing â€” the kind of growth that lasts.
