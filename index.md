# Welcome to My Cloud Security Journey! ☁️🔒

Hey, I’m **Happy** and I am learning AWS and all things cloud security.  
Sometimes I mess up, sometimes I succeed, and this is where I share it all: lessons, experiments, and real-life “oops” moments. No fluff, just honest learning.

## Why This Blog Exists

When I first started with AWS, I only used the root account. I lost my MFA device, couldn’t log in, and realized the hard way why **IAM users are essential**.  
Now I’m documenting every lesson, experiment, and “oops” moment so others can learn too.
